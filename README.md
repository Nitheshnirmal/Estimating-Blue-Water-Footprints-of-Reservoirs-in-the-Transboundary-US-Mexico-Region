I-GUIDE NSF Summer School 2024 Team 3 Scripts

This submission includes the scripts, data, and methodologies developed for the I-GUIDE Summer School 2024 Team 3 project, aimed at estimating changes in reservoir storage for the Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico, using a combination of remote sensing data and machine learning models. The project leverages both Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to accurately predict reservoir storage volumes. These models are trained on a comprehensive dataset that integrates in-situ measurements and remote sensing data collected over a 33-year period, from 1990 to 2023. By combining historical records with advanced remote sensing inputs, the study provides a robust framework for understanding and forecasting reservoir storage changes. This approach offers valuable insights for water resource management and planning in the face of climatic variability and changing hydrological conditions.
